i7tohtml: Andrew Plotkin's i7tohtml.py hacked for inf7

https://github.com/erkyrath/glk-dev/blob/master/i7tohtml.py

Per the original, this script is in the public domain.

Original description follows:

--
i7tohtml.py: Simple syntax-coloring wrapper for Inform 7
Written by Andrew Plotkin. This script is in the public domain.

This script converts Inform 7 source code to HTML, adding syntax coloring
in a way which I like. Strings, comments, and substitutions are colored
to resemble the I7 IDE. I6 source inclusions are shown in fixed-width,
with strings and comments colored but no other I6 elements called out.

(I don't try to mark I7 inclusions in the I6. Doesn't seem worth it.)

The real work is done by the Pygments syntax-coloring library. This requires
Pygments 2.0, which is unreleased (as I write this). You'll have to get it
from the source repository: http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/

(This script is Python 3. I haven't tested it in Python 2. It would probably
get Unicode wrong.)
